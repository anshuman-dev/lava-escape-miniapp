## Development Workflow

### Standard Development Process
1. **Planning Phase**: Use TodoWrite tool to break down complex tasks
2. **Implementation Phase**: Follow modular approach (contracts → integration → UI)
3. **Testing Phase**: Use debug mode (?debug=true) for troubleshooting
4. **Deployment Phase**: Testnet first, then mainnet with verification

### Code Organization
- **Smart Contracts**: `/contracts/` directory with Solidity files
- **Frontend**: Single `index.html` with modular script sections
- **Configuration**: `.well-known/farcaster.json` for mini app manifest
- **Documentation**: README.md with comprehensive deployment guide

## Environment Setup
- Platform: GitHub Codespaces
- Working Directory: /workspaces/lava-escape-miniapp
- Git Status: Clean (main branch)

## Notes and Decisions

### Technical Architecture Decisions - 2025-08-01
- **Minimal Onchain Strategy**: Only store lives onchain to reduce gas costs and complexity
- **Base L2 Choice**: Selected for low fees, Farcaster ecosystem alignment, and good tooling
- **No Framework Approach**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS for maximum compatibility and lightweight deployment
- **Wagmi Integration**: Used for robust Web3 functionality with Farcaster SDK wallet provider
- **Lives Pricing**: 0.001 ETH per life (~$3 USD) for accessible monetization
- **Leaderboard Design**: Top 100 players to balance storage costs with competition

### Smart Contract Design Decisions
- **LavaEscapeLives**: Separate contract for lives management with ETH/USDC payment options
- **LavaEscapeLeaderboard**: Dedicated leaderboard contract for gas-efficient score tracking
- **OpenZeppelin Integration**: Used for security (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard) and standards
- **Emergency Functions**: Added pause/withdrawal capabilities for contract management

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Lives Display**: Added to main game UI for constant awareness
- **Modal Design**: Buy lives and leaderboard modals for clean UX
- **Debug Mode**: URL parameter (?debug=true) for development visibility
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Game works without wallet, enhanced with onchain features

### Security Considerations
- **Minimum Score Requirement**: 5 jumps minimum to prevent leaderboard spam
- **Rate Limiting**: Built into smart contracts for transaction protection
- **Fallback Behavior**: Game continues to work if blockchain unavailable
- **Input Validation**: All contract inputs validated for security

### Session 2 - 2025-08-03
**Started:** Planning deployment strategy and BasePay integration
**Tasks Completed:**
- Researched BasePay integration for improved USDC payment UX
- Confirmed 0.0001 ETH pricing is optimal (already set in contracts)
- Created comprehensive testnet → mainnet deployment plan
- Analyzed transaction failure risks (none with current pricing)
- Documented external deployment actions required

**Decisions Made:**
- **BasePay Integration**: Will add BasePay for USDC payments alongside ETH option
  - Faster settlements (<2 seconds vs regular transactions)
  - Better UX with one-click Base Account payments
  - No extra fees, full USDC amount received
  - Broader user access (no ETH needed for gas)
- **Deployment Strategy**: Testnet first (Base Sepolia) then mainnet progression
- **Pricing Confirmation**: 0.0001 ETH (~$0.30) is perfect for accessibility and revenue

**Current Status:**
- Contracts ready with optimal pricing structure
- BasePay integration planned for dual payment options
- Comprehensive deployment plan created with external action items
- Ready to implement BasePay and proceed with testnet deployment

**Next Steps:**
- Implement BasePay integration in frontend
- Update deploy.js for testnet/mainnet deployment
- User actions: Get testnet funds, deploy contracts, test thoroughly
- Deploy to mainnet after successful testnet validation

## Deployment Plan & External Actions Required

### Phase 1: Base Sepolia Testnet
**External Actions You Must Do:**
1. Get Base Sepolia ETH: [Alchemy Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia)
2. Get test USDC: [Circle USDC Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) for Base Sepolia  
3. Deploy contracts: `node contracts/deploy.js` (testnet mode)
4. Verify on Base Sepolia explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org/
5. Test all functions: lives purchase, gameplay, leaderboard, BasePay
6. Document contract addresses for frontend update

### Phase 2: Base L2 Mainnet  
**External Actions You Must Do:**
1. Bridge ETH to Base: https://bridge.base.org/
2. Deploy contracts: `node contracts/deploy.js` (mainnet mode)
3. Verify on BaseScan: https://basescan.org/
4. Update frontend with mainnet contract addresses
5. Deploy to Netlify production
6. Register with Farcaster miniapp directory

### BasePay Integration Benefits
- **Payment Speed**: <2 seconds vs standard blockchain transactions
- **User Experience**: One-click payments with any Base Account
- **Cost Structure**: No extra fees, developers receive full USDC amount
- **Accessibility**: Users don't need ETH for gas fees
- **Payment Options**: Dual support for ETH and USDC payments

### Session 4 - 2025-08-09 (Farcaster Payment Integration)
**Started:** Implementing native Farcaster payment methods replacing BasePay
**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ **Complete BasePay removal**: Disabled problematic BasePay integration
- ✅ **Farcaster sendToken integration**: Implemented native USDC payments using Farcaster SDK
- ✅ **Dual payment UI**: Updated modal with USDC primary, ETH secondary, testing mode tertiary
- ✅ **Pricing standardization**: Set equivalent pricing (300,000 USDC units = 0.0001 ETH = $0.30)
- ✅ **Smart contract updates**: Enhanced LavaEscapeLives.sol with USDC support and manual crediting
- ✅ **ABI updates**: Added buyLivesWithUSDC function to frontend integration

**Payment System Architecture:**
- **Primary**: USDC via Farcaster `sendToken` action (recommended for users)
- **Secondary**: ETH via direct smart contract calls (fallback option)
- **Testing**: Simulated purchases for development
- **Backend Integration**: Manual credit system for USDC transfers (production needs automated service)

**Technical Implementation:**
- USDC payments use Base Sepolia testnet token (0x036CbD...F7e)
- Farcaster SDK sendToken sends USDC directly to contract address
- Temporary manual crediting system for testnet (production needs backend automation)
- Maintained full backward compatibility with existing ETH payment system

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Dual payment system fully implemented and functional
- Both ETH and USDC payment options available in UI
- Smart contracts support both payment methods
- Frontend handles Farcaster SDK integration gracefully
- Payment system ready for comprehensive testing

**Next Steps:**
- Comprehensive payment testing on Base Sepolia
- Backend service development for automated USDC credit processing
- Mainnet deployment with full payment automation

**DEPLOYED CONTRACT ADDRESSES (BASE SEPOLIA):**
- LavaEscapeLives: 0x5ce6ed6fbe544aba92dfb7850613e407781256f1
- LavaEscapeLeaderboard: 0xb11e64dc3835197c499fa894465891f3583780d6
